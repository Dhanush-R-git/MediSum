- **Arrows** show foreign key relationships.
- `generated_by` in summaries references `users._id`.
- `patient_id` in summaries references `patients._id`.

Notes:

- users._id is referenced in patients.created_by (which doctor created the patient) and in summaries.generated_by.

- To enforce data integrity, use MongoDBâ€™s unique indexes on username and patient_id. In production, also enable validations (e.g. via MongoDB schema validation).

- All user passwords are stored as a bcrypt hash (never plaintext).
